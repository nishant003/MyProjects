README for the Naive Bayes Classifier scripts used in Coding Assignment 2, USC course CSCI-544 (Applied Natural Language Processing), Spring 2018.

The code consists of two scripts:
- nblearn3.py: It trains on the labeled data and uses Naive Bayes to learn the labels of hotel reviews in the corpus. It stores the data in a test file “nbmodel.txt”.
- hmmdecode3.py: It takes “nbmodel.txt” and the testing data as inputs and labels the reviews in the corpus using Naive Bayes. The results are stored in “nboutput.txt”.

The scripts were written by Nishant Agarwal, agarwaln@usc.edu
