Some projects I have worked on in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.

1. Naive Bayes Classifier

•	A Naive Bayes classifier to detect sentiment (Positive/Negative) and validity (True/Fake) of hotel reviews
•	Mean F1 score for sentiment analysis: 93%
• Mean F1 score for validity analysis: 90%
• Programming Language: Python


2. POS Tagger

•	A part-of-speech tagger to determine most likely sequence of tags (like Noun, Verb) for words in a sentence using Hidden Markov Model and Viterbi decoding
•	Accuracy for Hindi: 93%
•	Accuracy for English: 90%
•	Accuracy for Chinese: 87%
• Programming Language: Python


3. Inference Engine

•	An AI-based agent to determine validity of query statement based on statements present in knowledge base
• Implemented first-order logic using forward chaining, resolution and unification algorithms
• Programming Language: C++


4. MiniMax Agent

•	An AI-based agent to play a board game called Fruit Rage against another agent or human
•	Implemented using minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning to determine next optimal move for the player
• Programming Language: C++


5. Animal Placement in Nursery

• Extension of N-Queens problem
• Implemented global search algorithms: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Simulated Annealing to place K animals in N * N nursery with obstructions
• Programming Language: C++
